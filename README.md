Type parents' genes and get a Punnett square of their potential offspring along with the genotype probabilities.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser (or publish it with GitHub Pages) and enter the genotypes for two parents.
Use paired alleles such as `AA`, `Aa`, or multi-locus pairs like `AaBb` for both parents. The app will generate
the Punnett square and simplify the probability of each genotype.
